## 14 days of learning ##

I've just finished みんなの日本語 (Minna no hihongo 1) and I wanted to share the experience that I've got so far. Its ~JLPT5 (A1)

Key points overall:
- This took me 2-4 hours of learning per day for 14 days straight
- Every day I had a 60-70 mins private lesson with a japanese native teacher (speaks english at B2). He helped a lot
- Thats **15$ per lesson so ~200$ total**. But you can find a tutor for ~8$ per hour or do it every other day. I've used https://preply.com/ but its all the same, just take a time to choose a person whose voice you'd like to listen to
> EDIT after day 365: thats way too much on a long way, can get to similar learning efficiency for much less money spent, see Final Thoughts
- Instead of the studybook I've used
  - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1l62G4pGqfQjcIS1VdspVuCm1Zi1wBPE lessons 1-13
  - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLag_mhJfCJ-1-EZcPapMFPTlzVzwjz33M rest
- For the textbook I've used its .pdf file inside the Adobe Acrobat. You can draw and write inside of it.
  - Its 25 lessons, each lesson contains 1-3 pieces of grammar with lots of examples
  - For writing just use the default Japanese IME, its convenient. But you need to google how to use its hotkeys
  - The textbook has okurigana all over the place so you can try to hide it for reading homework so you'll get used to kanji

Key points lessons 1-10:
- I already was able to read hiragana and katakana. It will take you one week top to learn it if you haven't yet, its easy. I didn't use any of the learning apps for it, just a paper notepad and a pen, thats more than enough
- So here we've speedrunned 2 lessons per day, if you ever tried to learn japanese, you'll know most of the grammar and vocabulary here (basic sentence structure, words types, basic particles)
- But don't try to **fully** comprehend the difference between e.g. "よ vs ね" using english translation/explanation. Thats a deep topic, that guy explain it pretty well - https://youtu.be/KjAL4RMr8XQ?si=s14nbZwh8DwUEfw5
> EDIT after day 365: yeah its highly context-dependent so you literally can't learn like the 80% of grammar without supplementary text where its used. Reading+listening is crucial to understanding
- Even if you use another textbook, take a look at the Minna no hihongo's listening audio files, its great
> EDIT after day 365: No, its not that great. Do not use it. Treir way of speaking is too artificial and too polite, real people don't talk like that
- Remember verb by its ～る form instead of ～ます form. Its more difficult but it **will** pay off on lessons 15+
> EDIT after day 365: yeah, still thinking the way they are giving ます form as a default one in some textbooks is really bad for learning. Also, as for me, learning verbs in pairs of transitivity 自動詞・他動詞 (if exists) also helps a lot

Key points lessons 10-20:
- After lesson 15 I've downloaded Anki with a Minna no hihongo deck - https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/988455958
  - I've also tried https://www.renshuu.org but its less related to the book and you'll have lots of unrelated vocabulary
  - You'll need an application for learning kanji eventually, the point is to learn them in context of its usecases
  - Not sure about RTK, WaniKani, but it feels like a stupid idea (meaning of the japanese words to the english meaning)
> EDIT after day 365: never actually got back to learning vocabulary using this shit. Its just boring. And not fun
- Numbers and counters are difficult in japanese, just focus on counting days, people and money for now
> EDIT after day 365: honestly don't even try spending time learning it. つ＋個 solves 99% of problems

Key points lessons 20-25:
- Do **not** try to learn informal speech, kansai dialect and whatsoever. You'll get to it at lesson 20. Tbh do not use it after lesson 20 either as I'll come with a practice when you'll feel you are actually non-cringy able to use it, basically most of the plain speech is just an implicitly shortened formal complex sentence. So if you know how to say it in formal - you mostly know how to say it in informal
> EDIT after day 365: it is very difficult to sound chill in japanese. informal speech applies that you use it consistently or else it just sounds weird. Also when using informal speech patterns its more likely you won't be understood, pitch accent and sound length are much more important there. So don't go all-in, transition to it slowly as you feel it

Key points after that:
- Japanese is fun and flexible (not as flexible as russian tho)
- I finally can construct flexible sentences in japanese a little bit, yay!
- Minna no hihongo 2 has 25 more lessons so see you in 25 days (I will continue to try to learn 1+ lesson every day).
- Do not use google translate. Instead:
  - Use https://www.deepl.com/ for translating sentences
  - Use https://jisho.org/ for translating words and looking for verbs forms. Its perfect
  - I've used https://chat.openai.com/ for like "Difference between たいせつ and だいせつ". Use with caution
  - Use wikitionary if just curious, https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E8%B1%A1 
  - For the grammar reference - https://imabi.org/ but its really deep, instead may be https://guidetojapanese.org/learn/category/grammar-guide/

## 40 days of learning ##

I've just finished みんなの日本語 (Minna no hihongo 2) and once again wanted to share the experience of trying to get into that stuff. Its ~JLPT4 (A2)
- It took another 25 days (1 lesson per day every single day, fits in an hour perfectly. And another hour for the homework)
- Money spent - 375$ (overall 575$)
- Textbook - again just pdf file
- Studybook - again just a youtube playlist https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLag_mhJfCJ-2sBVFtpD-tI79jmR4G02lN

Key points mistakes from the previous one:
- Turned out https://www.renshuu.org is a bit better than the Anki. Just because it has voiced pronunciation after each answer. I haven't found an Anki deck with the same quality image+hiragana+kanji+sound things. There are some convenient buttons to remove useless words from the deck (I personally remove all the katakana words). Also its difficult to keep learning/repeating words every morning+evening, some kind of reminder is required
> EDIT after day 365: renshuu lacks context. It says "出かける" means "to go out" with little to no examples, there's no way you can use vocabulary you learn from it

Key points, lessons 26-30:
- Try to keep in mind the mostly used synonyms of words you learning (e.g. 生きる vs 住む) and understand the contextual difference at least just a little bit
- With a teacher, you can discuss the other ways to express the same meaning (and slightly different meaning) of the sentences provided by the textbook. 60 minutes is still enough for one lesson with that kind of exercises

Key points, lessons 30-35:
- Each lesson you are getting more and more kind of kana-only written words (～ければ、また、ください etc.). Its useful to look up their origin kanji meaning because its easier to understand the meaning that way
> EDIT after day 365: still, after every single new word I ask a teacher how is it different is meaning to those 1-2 synonyms I know already and sometimes its really obscure knowledge you have to know to be able to distinguish those words. Sometimes even teacher himself starts googling how to explain that specific difference because sometimes it just feels right but there's no right words to explain why does it feel right. 当て字 and 四字 add up to the level of obscurity
- You don't need to learn any tables or cheatsheets of adjectives/verbs/nouns tenses/cases/inflections (at least I didn't) because you'll get an algorithmical approach to the sentence structure which is bad. Already at this point you can start to feel the right way to change a word into the right form, it just requires a little bit of practice

Key points, lessons 35-40:
- For time saving, some obscure grammar could be only learned to the point of being understood without being able to use it freely in speech (e.g. using くださる instead of くれる) so you can focus on more important things
> EDIT after day 365: yeah, nobody aint give a shit about humble speech but some of those words are etymologically the parents of their non-humble alternatives so sometimes its just easier to remember words and kanji that way (?) ig

Key points, lessons 40-45:
- Too many conditional forms in the language (とき、と、なら、ら、場合は、から、て、…) so yeah, making complex sentences is a bit difficult, need to do it more while practicing to get used. But its essential, conditional sentences is what you actually use a lot in speech
> EDIT after day 365: so far I find ったら and れば among the most used+useful ones. The single most useful conjunction is って (という) (ということ). Helps smoothing transitions between sentences a lot

Key points, lessons 45-50:
- Lessons 49-50 are both polite honorific stuff, just loads of unnecessary vocabulary. Not sure why they've put so much honorific stuff into the elementary level of the japanese language standard

Key points after that:
- Anyway need to increase the time spent (e.g. before sleep and at morning) learning vocabulary, thats already 3000+ words at the time and you'll get more and more every lesson. I've spent not enough time for it and now struggling a little bit recovering the pacing.
- Overall I've skipped lots of homework pages (had less time this month because of work) which turned out to be a mistake as some grammar still feels difficult to use
- Guess I can't pass actual JLPT4 yet, not enough practice, gonna focus on repeating already learnt in the next 25 days while going through Minna no hihongo 3

## 100 days of learning ##

- Can't imagine my day anymore without a lesson :) still haven't missed a single day and not going to (at least in 2024)
- Money spent overall - 1500$, looks huge but the explanation of the difficult parts from the teacher really help a lot and speeds up the learning process. Also extra motivation
- Current textbook - Marugoto (https://marugoto.jpf.go.jp/en/about/series/) Pre-Intermediate (A2/B1)

Key points:
- Minna no Nihongo 3 was too much more diffucult than 2 (e.g. too fast speech on listening excercises) so we've switched to Marugoto thats somewhere in between those books and fits perfectly
- Today we've almost finished the last page in Marugoto so can prove the whole book is a good one, lots of listening tasks, almost no furigana (so you're getting used to read kanji) and the overall vocabulary is really useful
- Watching anime could also work but honestly I don't know, doesn't seem as effective as expected
> EDIT after day 365: ironically didn't watch anime for the past year, just tried a couple of times. I guess theres a bunch of good ones with dialogues that sound natural. So probably give it a try later. You have to watch the same episode like 5 times and rewatch difficult voice lines with a translation, not the most fun experience in my opinion, not the most effective neither
- Listening to the old (19xx) slow japanese songs works tho it's not for everyone, could sound too boring if you're pop enjoyer
- Approximately a week ago I've started using VrChat and turned out its 10000% better that anything I've tried for speaking practice before. Community is really kind and theres a lot japanese native who are ready to talk about random stuff. Already at a B1 point of japanese knowledge you're able to get a meaningful conversation in japanese and it even greatly increases the motivation to learn futher. Trying to spend at least 30 minutes a day visiting language exchange worlds there. PC/android versions exist btw. See (resources/vrchat.png) to see how it looks like if curious (its really convenient you can write and draw everywhere to explain your thoughts) and (resources/Q.md) for examples of a new vocabulary I occasionaly encountered while hanging out there
> EDIT after day 365: should be 2-3 people group world to learn anything if you're not an advanced speaker. 4+ people's conversations are too difficult to understand and goes too fast and too much slang. 1v1 conversations are the best, all of those people are very kind and take time to explain a difficult word/phrase if you ask
- At the point somewhere around B1-B2 is where the teacher isn't needed anymore as you can learn just by consuming media (from english learning perspective but so far japanese learning curve looks the same). The only difference is you need to look up the kanji pronouncuation from time to time
> EDIT after day 365: the most important point of this whole adventure right here. It just works, and it works for any language which is awesome when you think about it
- Overall japanese is much closer to russian than to english (by feeling, grammar-wise I'd say)
- これからアプリケーションなし日本語だけ使っています。
今文の大体の家事を知りますけど、友達にチャットを使いながらグーグルで意味を見せっています。調べることついて、話すことにも問題があまりなりません。最近チャットを始めたら、けっこ新設な日本人を会ったら、言語の勉強することが楽しくて幸せになりました。今からできるだけ夜にこのまま練習しようと思います！

> *Translated with DeepL.com* I'm going to start using only Japanese without any applications.
> I now know most of the sentence structure, but I am using Google to find the meaning while chatting with my friends. I have little problem with researching and speaking the language. I have recently started chatting and meeting some very new Japanese people, which makes learning the language fun and happy. I will continue to practice at night as much as possible from now on!

## 200 days of learning ##

- I'm obsessed
- Money spent overall - 3000$. Not that much for the 6 months tbh, *copium* 最後に私たちの道は一番大切なもの…
- I think the most important thing so far is an ability to explain an unknown term or word using longer sentence with simpler words. 一番大事なことは、例えば、わからない言葉が合うときは、ちがい簡単な言葉で説明することができます(もうトライした)。その思います
> *Translated with DeepL.com* The most important thing is that, for example, when there is a word that you don't understand, you can explain it in simpler words (I've already tried).
- After acquiring that 'explanation ability' the teacher isn't required anymore as you're able to learn just by talking to people. 簡単な言葉で説明するようにできるになりますの後で先生なし続けられますし、話しながら勉強できます。これはAとBのレベルの違いと思います。
- でも時々、代わりに、英語を話しながら日本語の単語を入れてしまう(笑)
- あの「日本語だけ」の言葉、多いが会った、例えば、「大変」の翻訳がない、大変の時は「大変」だけと言います。けっこ便利です（相手が日本語を喋る時場合は）

> *Translated with DeepL.com* After you learn to explain things in simple terms, you can continue without a teacher and study while speaking. I think this is the difference between levels A and B.
> But sometimes, instead, I insert Japanese words while speaking English (lol)
> There are a lot of "Japanese only" words, for example, there is no translation for "tough", so when it's tough, I just say "tough". It's quite convenient (when the other person speaks Japanese)

Key points (actually just one big crucial point):
- Current textbook - Nihongo so matome (https://omgjapan.com/products/nihongo-so-matome-jlpt-n3-reading-comprehension) N3 (B1-B2)
  - Only using 'Reading comprehension' book, skipping other products as it doesnt make any sense. Still haven't found the perfect learning material but now I understand which kind of textbook is actually required for learning - there should just be as much texts and dialogues as possible. But not just texts, it also needs question after the text about understanding whats happening in the text. Others ways (content of 95% japanese textbooks) are just a waste of time. E.g. quizzes like 'put a word in a right grammatical form', 'choose the right word from 4', 'here's a grammar reference excel table, learn it'. If you're not gonna aim to speedrun JLPT exam all that shit is completely useless. 'Reading comprehension', on the other hand, shows you all that vocabulary and grammar used in the context of natural-ish conversation so its way easier to remember and use
  - But after getting through like 50% of the book, here we go again - polite-language-related stuff. As the most of the textbooks it also fails to consistently give a student an actual vocabulary. Like, the first 30% of the book was awesome but now every single lesson contains some obscure polite shit you won't ever use in your life
  - So basically the whole previous 100+ days experience was good but could've been at least 2x more effective if I knew all that shit before. See (resources/matome.png) to see how it looks like
- Still haven't consistently used any Anki, SRS and other shit, too boring in comparison with 'just reading stuff'. Overall its told you just need to encounter a word in a text 10 times to perfectly remember the meaning of a word. So for now I'm sticking to a point that SRS is kinda overrated by the same peeps who are aiming to passing the language exam, not actually using a language. Even if it could be worth using, you can't use any of the existing decks, needs to be slowly and steadily collected by your own, with all the vocabulary being in context you've already encountered
- 'I have no free time' is not an argument for not starting doing a new hobby, ain't no way you don't have a spare 1-2 hours a day lol

## 365 days of learning ##

- *The end is never the end is never the end is never the end is never the end is never the end is never the end is never the end is never...*
- Money spent overall - $5475. By any consideration, that's not a small amount so I won't recommend this to anyone. Tho this was really convenient having constant support and explanation from an actual person. But I don't think you'll get different result spending around $1000 per year, most likely possible even for free with the same efficiency if you know what to do and how to do it. I've done it for the whole 365 days just for the sake of experiment completion, the actual highly effective period were the first ~3 months when we were getting through N5 and N4 grammar which you have to know to be able to progress further by consuming media and stuff by yourself
- rikaikun is a saviour when it comes to reading. Not as accurate as japanese->japanese dictionaries but much better for a beginner https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/rikaikun/jipdnfibhldikgcjhfnomkfpcebammhp

Key points:

- There was an experiment of taking random everyday life dialogues and translate it into japanese. That way I'm trying to translate a sentence and teacher points out the mistakes and the things that doesn't sound natural. This one was kinda good tho could be even better if its not just a [dialogue -> dialogue] translation, should've been a [picture -> dialogue] translation, that way there's more freedom of expressing yourself. Anyway, was a good way of learning a bit more how small talk is constucted and used
  - Theres an example of dialogues can be used for those type of things (it doesn't have to make lots of sense, thats just for ones who can't come up with a dialogue idea by themselves. More like a list of topics to build a dialogue upon): https://agendaweb.org/listening/practical-english-conversations.html
- There was an experiment of checking generic textbooks again (N3 level), didn't go well. I thought it'll make a difference when you're not a beginner anymore but no, textbooks as a progression tool sucks (who would've guessed lol). But turned out it works well when you use it as a handbook while reading something else. Like, you've encounter an unknown/forgotten piece of grammar - you look up in google which chapter of a textbook is it then look up that specific grammar piece in a textbook. This is the only way grammar reference should be used, this way you will be always learning it in the context of an actual usecase so less chances you'll miss on specifics. Now that I'm thinking about it, its literally what textbooks were made for. I guess you just have to go through this experience to actually understand it
- There's a great podcast for listening training just good for that transition between N4 and N3: https://open.spotify.com/show/7rzB4zCdrSf67jd3nHm8Vy?si=a97592b907594f35 (there's other similar things, the point is - actual podcasts were too difficult to me, they speak too fast. This one doesnt feel artificial yet still is slow enough and uses easy vocabulary)
- Reading children (~10 yo) fairy tales is fun and effective but requires a native japanese person to explain history-cultural-related stuff. Pros - theres repeated vocabulary in those stories. I mean, difficult words are commonly used 3-4 times through the text so you have enough time to remember it. So definitely use for vocabulary improvement intead of learning dictionaries as there the words are used in a context and actually make sense. Cons - a bit of legacy rarely-used vocabulary. I have fun learning about words origins, etymology and stuff but that's not for everyone. E.g., in mermaid story there's a obscure writing 怜悧 not a single sane person uses, which should've been 利口
  - ごん狐 https://www.yanabe-e.ed.jp/01nankitiMap/nankiti_siryo/gon_zenbun.htm
  - じんざのサーカス https://fanblogs.jp/hamitellslibrary/archive/1/0
  - 赤い蝋燭と人魚 (more difficult) https://www.aozora.gr.jp/cards/001475/files/54372_46225.html
- There's not a whole lot of vocabulary you have to know to talk to people. Meaning of lots of verbs can be easily guessed from the context and the other way around. And even if you don't know the specific word meaning you can always ask for an explanation

## Final thoughts ##

- If I could start again from the beginning I'd do little to no change to the first 1 month of learning N5-related stuff, its already kinda minmaxxed on the textbook side, can't see how it can be done a lot faster. I'd say this first month is the least fun activity in language learning in general. You just have to go through it, its much better later on when you get to construct first simple reasonable arbitrary sentences
- But as for the N4, I'd incorporate more listening and reading without rushing all the grammar. I still occasionally getting back to those grammar elements because I didn't remember it well when it. Also there was only a couple of homeworks on writing your little story about something, I'd change it to having to write at least 1 story per week. Highly effective because you make lots of mistakes and then learn by those mistakes, for reference see (resources/B1_hw1.md)
- After getting into N3-ish stuff (actual N3, call it B1-B2 in terms of english, but not just a grammar side, when you've got how convenient that language is and can consume its content without suffering) you literally can continue learning on your own, by talking to people, by watching tv, by reading books etc.
- I'm far from fluent, I'm far from being able to freely small talk on a random topic (its only been 400 hours after all) (tho at this point when I'm talking to japanese people I don't feel like being a nuisance to them in comparison to how it was in the beginning, that contrast just feels good)
- Japanese is more difficult than English, japanese doesn't surround you as much in life if you're not living in Japan (the only exception are those people who are managing to immerse themselves. I can't. And even if I could, I find it bad because it affect other aspects of life but I don't want a hobby that changes how I spend my time outside that hobby)
